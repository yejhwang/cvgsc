Looking at commercial video games with available source code
- genre of the game
- first release date
- source code release date
- developer
- etc.

web scraping

How (might have) does the Open Data Movement, which was active since the mid 2000's, impact commercial markets?

Does the length of time before the source code became available relate to the type of the game (genre)?

Suggestions: Would likely need to talk to experts in gaming to make sure that there aren't confounding factors besides the Open Data Movement that might have pushed markets in similar directions.
